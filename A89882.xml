            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But the main <hi>Scandal</hi> in the eight <hi>Querie</hi> is a <hi>≈øtory</hi> wherein he <hi>parallels</hi> the proceedings of the <hi>Army</hi> with the <hi>Anabapti≈øts</hi> at <hi>Mun≈øter,</hi> with the ≈øame <hi>ungracious</hi> impudence, as he does by the Rebellion of <hi>Iack Cade</hi> in the ≈øecond <hi>Querie,</hi> and ≈øo gives the <hi>City</hi> an <hi>Alarm</hi> to <hi>≈øtand upon their Guard.</hi> It's well you'l be content with that <hi>po≈øture</hi> now, but certain it is, the <hi>De≈øigne,</hi> when it was fir≈øt <hi>conceived</hi> in darknes, and the <hi>privy Iunto</hi> of <hi>Confederates</hi> had <hi>travailed</hi> with it a whole night, was <hi>brought forth</hi> in the morning, a fair <hi>Cockney</hi> with the <hi>face</hi> of a <hi>new warr;</hi> which was <hi>nour≈øt</hi> up very <hi>carefully</hi> for a few daies, till the <hi>Citizens</hi> ≈øaw it would prove a very <hi>chargeable brat,</hi> and ≈øo it was immediatly <hi>≈ømothered.</hi> I appland their <hi>wi≈øedom,</hi> that they were able to ≈øee them≈øelves made but a <hi>≈øtalking-hor≈øe</hi> to ≈øerve other mens <hi>private ends;</hi> and I cannot but commend their <hi>re≈øolution</hi> to free them≈øelves from all ≈øuch like <hi>pur≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milking</hi> Complots for the <hi>future,</hi> which tend only to draw on the <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>innocent</hi> blood, and <hi>draine</hi> the <hi>publick</hi> trea≈øure of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> to ≈øupport the <hi>ambitious intere≈øts</hi> of <hi>particular</hi> men. And as for the <hi>Army,</hi> I doubt not but all men of this famons City <hi>unintere≈øted</hi> (or not wrought upon and amu≈øed by per≈øons <hi>Intere≈øted</hi>) are really ≈øatisfyed with their <hi>candid</hi> and <hi>≈øincere</hi> Intentions towards this <hi>City,</hi> ≈øo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed <hi>declared</hi> and <hi>remon≈øtrated:</hi> And if through the <hi>≈øeditious</hi> provocations of ≈øuch <hi>furies</hi> as our <hi>Lawyer,</hi> they entertaine a <hi>cau≈øele≈ø≈øe jealou≈øie,</hi> and be urged thereby to act in prejudice of the Army, that <hi>pa≈ø≈øionate</hi> love which I beare to the <hi>renown</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of this <hi>delight of the Nation,</hi> makes me tremble to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114285:7"/>think into what <hi>fatall Con≈øequences</hi> ≈øuch cur≈øed <hi>Coun≈øellours</hi> would <hi>allure</hi> and <hi>in≈ønare</hi> them: And therefore they had be≈øt be well advi≈øed, that they behave them≈øelves with ≈øuch <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> as to do nothing but in order to their owne <hi>defence,</hi> from the injuries of <hi>di≈øcontented</hi> enemies within, and without the lea≈øt ≈øhadow of <hi>provocation</hi> to their friends without, it re≈øting upon their wi≈øe <hi>carriage,</hi> either to burie the <hi>≈øeeds</hi> of <hi>warre, ≈øedition</hi> and <hi>tumult,</hi> in an honourable <hi>Peace,</hi> or the <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈ø≈øe</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> in a <hi>new Rupture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the ninth and la≈øt <hi>Querie,</hi> wherein he taxes the <hi>Armies</hi> demand of a ≈øpeedy <hi>An≈øwer</hi> to their <hi>Remon≈øtrance,</hi> to be the <hi>highe≈øt, arrogante≈øt, and unrea≈øonable≈øt that ever was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed,</hi> &amp;c. I ≈øhall ≈øay no more but this, that <hi>nece≈ø≈øity</hi> admits of no <hi>delay</hi> in <hi>Affaires</hi> of this nature, ≈øeeing it were as much as to put them≈øelves to the <hi>hazzard</hi> of an <hi>After-game,</hi> when their <hi>enemies</hi> are <hi>vi≈øibly</hi> active upon the <hi>Counter-plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I ≈øhall conclude only with one <hi>Anti-querie,</hi> in oppo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his nine <hi>Queries,</hi> viz: Whether if the <hi>Author</hi> of tho≈øe <hi>impudent, fal≈øe,</hi> and <hi>≈øeditious Queries,</hi> have no <hi>eares</hi> to lo≈øe, hee de≈øerve not to bee <hi>cramp't</hi> in that <hi>right Thumb,</hi> which hath heretofore condemned ≈øo much <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> to <hi>confu≈øion;</hi> and now at la≈øt, mo≈øt <hi>impiou≈øly</hi> ≈øcandalized our <hi>be≈øt friends,</hi> as enemies of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
